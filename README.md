# TPSDemo
I created this TPS project with Unreal Engine 4.20. It is my free time project during my summer holiday. I used animation started pack to animate the character. I created whole animation implementation and weapon system by myself. I learned a number of things from the project such as Locomotion system, Blend System, RayTracing and Projectile weapon system etc.
